rtorrent-scripts
================

My scripts for installing and running rtorrent and rutorrent on ubuntu. These scripts assume a server install with only ssh installed. The combination of nginx, php-fpm and httprpc make this a very speedy webui, even when managing 1000's of torrents.

To run:

```
sudo ./Ubuntu_13.10.sh
```
